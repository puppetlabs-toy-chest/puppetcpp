Running With Docker
-------------------

The `peterhuene/puppetcpp` image on Docker Hub contains a pre-built version of the prototype compiler.

Use the following docker command to run the compiler:

    $ docker run -it peterhuene/puppetcpp

This image is not yet automatically updated when commits are merged into master; it will be periodically updated when new features are merged.


Build Requirements
------------------

* OSX or Linux
* GCC >= 5.0 or Clang >= 3.4 (with libc++)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) >= 3.0
* [Boost Libraries](http://www.boost.org/) >= 1.60.0
* [ICU](http://site.icu-project.org/) >= 57.1
* [Onigmo](https://github.com/k-takata/Onigmo) >= 5.15.0 (build with `--enable-multithread`)
* [Facter](https://github.com/puppetlabs/facter) >= 3.0
* [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp) >= 0.5.1
* [Editline](http://thrysoee.dk/editline/) (optional - improves the REPL experience)

Pre-Build
---------

All of the following examples start by assuming the current directory is the root of the repo.

Before building, use `cmake` to generate build files:

    $ mkdir release
    $ cd release
    $ cmake ..

To generate a fully debug build use `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` when invoking `cmake`.

To speed up builds, it is recommended to use [ccache](https://ccache.samba.org/) as the "compiler":

    $ cd release
    $ CCACHE_SLOPPINESS=pch_defines,time_macros cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=$(which ccache) -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_ARG1=cc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=$(which ccache) -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ARG1=c++

**Note: the environment variable `CCACHE_SLOPPINESS` must be set to `pch_defines,time_macros` for precompiled headers to work with ccache.**

Also consider using [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) as a replacement for GNU Make:

    $ cd release
    $ cmake .. -GNinja -DDISABLE_PCH=1 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=$(which ccache) -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_ARG1=cc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=$(which ccache) -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ARG1=c++

Then use `ninja` instead of `make` in the examples below.

**Note: tracking precompiled header changes with ninja is [currently unsupported in CMake](https://cmake.org/Bug/view.php?id=13234) so it is recommended to add `-DDISABLE_PCH=1` when running cmake.**

Build
-----

To build puppetcpp, use 'make':

    $ cd release
    $ make

To build puppetcpp with debug information:

    $ cd debug
    $ make

Run
---

You can run puppetcpp from its output directory:

`$ release/bin/puppetcpp help`

For a debug build:

`$ debug/bin/puppetcpp help`

Test
----

You can run puppetcpp tests using the test target:

    $ cd release
    $ make test

For a debug build:

    $ cd debug
    $ make test

For verbose test output, run `ctest` instead of using the test target:

    $ cd release
    $ ctest -V

Install
-------

You can install puppetcpp into your system:

    $ cd release
    $ make && sudo make install

By default, puppetcpp will install files into `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/local/lib`, and `/usr/local/include`.

To install to a different location, set the install prefix:

    $ cd release
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/puppetcpp ..
    $ make clean install

This would install puppetcpp into `~/puppetcpp/bin`, `~/puppetcpp/lib`, and `~/puppetcpp/include`.

Uninstall
---------

Run the following command to remove files that were previously installed:

    $ sudo xargs rm < release/install_manifest.txt

Documentation
-------------

To generate API documentation, install doxygen 1.8.7 or later.

    $ doxygen

To view the documentation, open `html/index.html` in a web browser.
